# StealthPyChat
AES/RSA-Encrypted Python console chat.

This project's main objective for me was to learn the basics of the Public Key cryptography utilized in our day-to-life, primarily, by means of online chatting and web interactions as a whole.

The chat incorporates the following functions:

1) Diffie-Hellman key exchange combined with the hybrid AES/RSA encryption
2) Digital signatures
3) Multiple client connection handling (multitheading)
4) KeyWord server-to-client interaction
5) Chat logging into a file.

NOTICE: chat does not have user rooms as a built-in function.
