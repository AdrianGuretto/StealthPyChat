# StealthPyChat
AES/RSA-Encrypted Python console chat.

This project's main objective for me was to learn the basics of Public Key cryptography implemented in our day-to-life, primarily, by the means of online chatting and web interactions; additionally, I thought this would be a brilliant idea to learn socket as well as OOP programming in Python to the core.

The chat incorporates the following funcrions:

1) Diffie-Hellman key exchange combined with the hybrid AES/RSA encryption
2) Digital signatures
3) Multiple client connection handling (multitheading)
4) Key-Word server-to-client interaction
